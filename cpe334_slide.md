# **Some Aj. Chaiyong's Inspirations On the Project**
- **HCI and UI Design**: We would try to make it clean and being responsive for many devices as it can be used to watch the stock analysis.
- **System Cohesion**: For the class diagram, we are trying to make the system to be systematic and organizing to be more efficient on running the symple software with the many backend process working for the platform.
- **Version Control**: For our project, we try to implement our code and save within GitHub Repository for many commits as possible for preventing the accident of some errors of the code in the project. At some point, we can recall or roll back the previous version of the code if we found the problem when somebody in the group accidentally push the errors in the repository.
